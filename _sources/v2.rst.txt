V2 API bindings
===============

..
   If you are reading this: most of the V2 API client being dynamically
   generated, its documentation is generated as well. In order to browse it:

   - See the generated documentation at
     https://exoscale.github.io/python-exoscale/v2.html, or

   - run ``make html`` from the root of the source tree and open
     build/html/v2.html.
